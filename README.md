# random-pulser
A random puse generator for testing x-ray detectors. It is based on a Linear Feedback Shift Register pseudo-random number generator. The random numbers it generates are compared to a threshold value. If the number is below that value a pulse is emitted. The pulse is stretched by a one-shot and presented on a pin. Eventually, that pulse will be filtered by an analog circuit to form a tail pulse, i.e. a pulse with a fast rising edge and a slow trailing edge. Such a pulse, when presented to an x-ray detector readout circuit, effectively simulates the arrival of an x-ray in the detector sensor. The random component is necessary because such readout circuits behave differently when subjected to random events (which is what typical x-rays sources deliver) compared to a periodic pulse train.
